    content: "You are a senior front‑end engineer tasked with revamping the RE:MIND web application. Follow the branding guide (primary blue #2563EB, purple accent #7C3AED, success green #10B981, alert red #EF4444, neutrals gray‑50–gray‑900\nraw.githubusercontent.com\n). Your goal is to simplify the interface, remove any demo or placeholder features, implement a robust dark‑mode toggle, and ensure quick reminder creation (target under 3\_seconds) across devices. Use Tailwind CSS and Next.js best practices. Consolidate voice and quick‑add features into a single modal, refactor navigation, and create a design system using the provided colour and typography specifications. Prioritise accessibility (WCAG\_AA), responsive design and performance. Provide updated code snippets (with file paths) and brief explanations of your changes."

    content: "Our RE:MIND app needs a full UI/UX overhaul. Please:\n\nRemove all demo or booth code – delete the FloatingAssistant, ad banners (MockAd/AdBlocker), Pro Features button, templates placeholder and any routes under /demo or /booth.\n\nImplement a single Quick‑Add modal combining text and voice input. It should parse natural language, suggest quick times (30\_min, 1\_h, Tomorrow\_9\_am) and allow editing before saving.\n\nRebuild navigation – keep only essential tabs (Dashboard, Events, Tasks, Settings), move advanced actions to a secondary menu, and add a floating “Add Reminder” button accessible on all pages.\n\nAdd a dark‑mode toggle using Tailwind’s dark: classes. Include light and dark colour tokens based on our palette and ensure text contrast meets WCAG\_AA guidelines.\n\nStandardise design – use the specified colour palette, typography scales and spacing system. Update all components accordingly.\n\nEnsure responsiveness and accessibility – buttons should be touch‑friendly, keyboard navigable and labelled with aria attributes.\nProvide the updated code for each modified file with comments explaining major changes. Where appropriate, suggest file refactors or new components."
